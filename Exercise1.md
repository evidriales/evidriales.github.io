## Exercise 1

### Dataset
This dataset about curb ramps is provided by San Francisco Government Open Data. This data includes locations of curb ramps around the San Francisco Bay Area, including coordinates and position. This dataset also contains information on the slopes of curb cuts and scores about the conditions of each ramp.

As someone with a physical disability, I know how important curb ramps can be for people whose mobility is limited by steps. Currently, there does not appear to be a map of these points. Being able to use this data with GIS could be extremely useful. Mapping the points for where the curb cuts are and adding information/filters about the conditions or slope could potentially help wheelchair users, or people with strollers planning out a trip. Being able to plot these points could give better insight as to where curb ramps should be added, or updated. Making areas more accessible can help make people with mobility issues' world bigger. 

### Data Science Book
In *ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis (3e)* (Wickham, Navarro, Pederson, in-progress book), an in-depth review of the R package, ggplot2, takes place. ggplot2 is used to create graphics. Different types of plots, charts, and maps can be created using ggplot2. All of these visuals are completely customizable. This book grabbed my attention, because I enjoy making data visuals and I have used ggplot2 in the past. An old professor I had would mention one of the authors of the book, Hadley Wickham, often and how he is someone who has made many contributions to R. When looking through the book, I learned more about ggplot2's map making capabilities. I hope to be able to try these soon.
